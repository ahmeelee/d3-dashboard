1. Load chocolate sales data from a CSV file (Chocolate-Sales.csv) using D3.js.

2. Set up a responsive dashboard layout that includes:
   - A time series area chart for sales trends
   - A bar chart showing top-selling products
   - A searchable and scrollable data table

3. Implement the time series area chart:
   - Show total sales amount by date
   - Add a brushing feature to select a date range
   - When a range is selected, filter the table accordingly
   - Clicking a specific date should highlight that point and filter both the bar chart and table
   - Clicking again should reset the selection

4. Implement the bar chart for top products:
   - Show the top 5, 10, or 20 products based on total sales
   - Add a dropdown to select how many top products to display
   - When a product is clicked, highlight the bar and fade out the others
   - Clicking the same bar again resets the selection

5. Create a data table:
   - Show the full dataset (country, product, date, amount)
   - Include a live search bar to filter by product name
   - Make the table scrollable and fixed in height
   - Clicking a table row should select the corresponding product and filter the charts

6. Ensure all components are fully connected:
   - Area chart, bar chart, and table should respond to each otherâ€™s selections
   - Only one filter (either date or product) should be active at a time
   - Resetting one selection restores the full view

7. Add smooth visual effects:
   - Use opacity to fade out unselected bars instead of changing colors
   - Use a distinct color (e.g., orange) to highlight selected data points in the time series
   - Make sure brushed regions update both the chart and axes correctly

8. Make the entire dashboard responsive:
   - Use `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio` in SVGs
   - Ensure layout adapts well on different screen sizes

9. Finalize and deliver the following files:
   - index.html
   - style.css
   - script.js
   - Chocolate-Sales.csv
   - README.md
   - prompt.txt
