1. Load sales data from a CSV file (Chocolate-Sales.csv) using D3.js.

2. Create a responsive dashboard layout:
   - Align the area chart (time series) and bar chart horizontally.
   - Place the searchable and scrollable data table underneath.

3. Implement a time series area chart showing total sales amount by date:
   - Allow brushing (dragging) to select a date range.
   - When a range is selected, the data table should filter accordingly.

4. Add click functionality to the time series chart:
   - Clicking on a specific date highlights that date.
   - When a date is clicked, the data table filters to show only entries from that date.
   - Clicking the same date again should deselect it.

5. Create a bar chart showing the top-selling products:
   - Allow the user to choose between displaying the Top 5, Top 10, or Top 20 products via a dropdown menu.
   - Clicking a bar highlights the selected product and fades out the non-selected bars (opacity change).
   - Clicking the selected bar again resets the selection.

6. Build a searchable and scrollable data table:
   - Include a search bar to dynamically filter the products by name.
   - Clicking a table row highlights the corresponding product in the bar chart and filters the other components accordingly.

7. Ensure full interaction linkage between all components:
   - Selecting a product (via bar chart or table) updates the area chart and table dynamically.
   - Selecting a date (via area chart) updates the bar chart and table dynamically.
   - Only one selection (product or date) should be active at a time â€” selecting one clears the other.

8. Apply smooth visual feedback:
   - Use opacity to fade out non-selected bars instead of changing colors.
   - In the area chart, highlight the selected date point with a different color or size.

9. Guarantee full responsiveness:
   - Use viewBox and preserveAspectRatio attributes in all SVG elements.
   - Ensure the layout and charts adapt automatically to different screen sizes.

10. Deliver the following files:
    - index.html
    - style.css
    - script.js
    - Chocolate-Sales.csv
    - README.md
    - prompt.txt
